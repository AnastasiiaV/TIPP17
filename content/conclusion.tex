The ELAD sensor it's a new sensor concept that allows for the possibility to achieve an improved position resolution with no need of making a smaller pitch or increasing the number of readout channels. 
The resolution improvement in ELAD sensors is accomplished by increasing the lateral size of the charge distribution. 
For this purpose, deep implants are included in the ELAD sensors. 
The characteristic length, which affects the spatial resolution is the distance between the deep implants rather than the pitch size. 
Dedicated simulations, conducted in the TCAD framework, prove that the charge sharing in ELAD sensors is possible. 
A new plan for a production technique for multi-layered structures with implantation was discussed.
