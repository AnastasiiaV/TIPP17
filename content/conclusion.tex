ELAD sensor it's a new sensor concept that gives a possibility to achieve a high position resolution without making a smaller pitch or increasing the number of readout channels. The improvement of resolution in ELAD sensors is accomplished by increasing the lateral size of the charge distribution. For this, in the ELAD sensors deep implants are included. The characteristic length affecting the spatial resolution is the distance between the deep implants rather than the pitch size. The simulations show that the charge sharing in ELAD sensors is possible. New production technique for creating multi-layered structures with implantation was developed.
