For ELAD sensor production is necessary to create a new manufacture technology. This new technology involve surface implantation and epitaxial growing. Epitaxial growing means growing of the crystal in the correct lattice structure on top of a single-crystal wafer [3]. One of the methods of epitaxial growing is a CVD method. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is the deposition of a solid material onto a heated substrate through a chemical reaction of compounds contained the gas passing over the substrate. The temperature in CVD method is around $1100^\circ C$. The surface implantation implemented by bombarding the substrate with accelerated ions.

The ELAD production includes several steps. First, on a p-type wafer, the first layer of deep implants is generated by surface implantation. Then, on the implanted wafer creates an epitaxial layer, in the surface of this epitaxial zone, puts the second layer of deep implants and the process repeats. 

The dangerous side of such production is a possibility of implants to diffuse during the CVD process, but TCAD process simulation shows that the difference in sizes of deep implants before and after 20 min heating up to $1100^\circ C$ less than 1 $\mu m$.
