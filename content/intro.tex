One of the main goals in the R$\&$D of tracker sensors technology is to increase the position resolution of the particle detector. There are two ways to achieve this. The most common way is to decrease the size of the read-out cell, i.e. to decrease the pixel or strip pitch. But in this case, the number of channels increases, which requires an increased bandwidth for the read-out. The other possibility to improve the position resolution of sensors is to increase the lateral size of the charge distribution already during the drift in the sensor material. In this case, it is necessary to carefully engineer the electric field in the bulk of this so-called enhanced lateral drift (ELAD) sensor. This new design is uses implants deep inside of the bulk. Implants constitute volumes with different values of doping concentration in comparison to the concentration in the bulk. This allows for modification of the drift path of the charge carriers in the sensor.
