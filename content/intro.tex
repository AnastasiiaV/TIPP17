Future experiments in particle physics require few-micrometer position resolution in their tracking detectors. Nowadays the silicon is the material of choice for high-precision detectors, as it provides a large variety of engineering possibilities. The most common way to achieve the high position resolution in tracking sensors is to decrease the size of the read-out cell, i.e. to decrease the pixel or strip pitch. This, however, increases the number of readout channels and requires larger bandwidth. The other possibility to improve the position resolution of the sensors is to increase the lateral size of the charge distribution already during the drift in the sensor material. In a standard sensor which is not operated in a magnetic field, all charge carriers are collected on one strip/pixel and the position resolution is proportional to the strip/pixel pitch. 

In a new sensor concept, instead of decreasing the pitch size, the electric field is changed by deep implants, which force the charge carriers to change their drift path. The implants constitute volumes of different doping concentration with respect to the concentration in the bulk. It is essential to carefully engineer the electric field in the bulk of this so-called enhanced lateral drift (ELAD) sensor.
