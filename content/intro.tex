Future experiments in particle physics require few-micrometer position resolution in their tracking detectors. 
Nowadays silicon is the material of choice for high-precision detectors, as it provides a large variety of engineering possibilities. 
The most common way to achieve a high position resolution in tracking sensors is to decrease the size of the read-out cell, i.e. to decrease the pixel or strip pitch. 
This, however, increases the number of readout channels and requires larger read-out bandwidth. 
Another possibility to improve the position resolution of the sensors is to increase the lateral size of the charge distribution already during the drift in the sensor material. 

In a new sensor concept, instead of decreasing the pitch size, the electric field is changed by implants deep inside the bulk, which forces the charge carriers to change their drift path. 
The first attempt of the design of an ELAD sensor was proposed in reference~\cite{JANSEN2016242}.
The implants constitute volumes of different doping concentration with respect to the concentration in the bulk. 
In order to achieve an optimal charge sharing to carefully engineer the electric field in the bulk of the ELAD sensor. %FIXME bad english. I gave you a hint in my first corrections, but you have to finish the sentence correctly yourself!
